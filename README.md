## Project Intro/Objective
The broad question we answer in this project is: which customers will purchase new packages, and if they do, how many?
We arrive at an answer using so called Buy 'Til You Die (BTYD) models of customer likelihood of making future purchases, along with ensemble methods (logistic regression and decision trees) to determine which studies will be purchased.

### Methods Used
* Web Scraping
* Machine Learning - Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

### Technologies

* Matplotlib

## Project Description
We have taken descriptions of board shorts and swim trunks from [Swim Outlet](https://www.swimoutlet.com/), which we believe is the larget online retailor of swimwear in the US. 
We would like to know how the "board shorts" and "swim trunks" categories of men's swimwear differ from each other. 
Specifically, we are accessing how well the categories distinguish between a garment having a stretch waist or not.
