# Swimwear Descriptions for Men


---

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
We hope to provide a better means of classifying  what type of fit men's swimwear bottoms will provide a customer. 
The current standard is "board shorts" or "swim trunks", but these labels can fail describe a particular pair of swimwear accurately. 
We will use natural language processing on garment descriptions provided by e-commerce sites to more accurately classify the type of fit a garment will provide.

### Methods Used
* Web Scraping
* Machine Learning - Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter
* sklearn
* NLTK
* Matplotlib

## Project Description
We have taken descriptions of board shorts and swim trunks from [Swim Outlet](https://www.swimoutlet.com/), which we believe is the larget online retailor of swimwear in the US. 
We would like to know how the "board shorts" and "swim trunks" categories of men's swimwear differ from each other. 
Specifically, we are accessing how well the categories distinguish between a garment having a stretch waist or not.
